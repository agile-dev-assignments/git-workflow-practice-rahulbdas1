What I Found Ineresting :

I found this article unique in that it exposes the problems with technology, especailly new technology. New programs and libraries are being built so fast that it is outdating older practices so quickly and companies are not inclined to chance their while software strucutre to accomodate to these new UI components. It becomes super problematic when coders are learning which technology to use. Whether they should stick to learning older tech or move on and learn new languages is a debate. New technology is great but the learning curve that it takes and the transition to a new tech is a big problem that will continue to be a problem for compaines in the future.
